		<center><h1>Welcome to the Python Programming CAS club!</h1></center>
		<p>
Hereâ€™s how this club will work: I will help you install Python and teach you basic concepts, syntax and terms, then we will create one or two simple projects. Then for the rest (60-80% of the term), I will help and guide each of you in creating your own projects individually. If some people complete their projects early and are willing, I will teach you some more advanced concepts. 

Here are the basic concepts we will be covering in the start of the term
