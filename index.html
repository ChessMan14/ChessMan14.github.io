		<center><h1>Welcome to the Python Programming CAS club!</h1></center>
		<p>
Here’s how this club will work: I will help you install Python and teach you basic concepts, syntax and terms, then we will create one or two simple projects. Then for the rest (60-80% of the term), I will help and guide each of you in creating your own projects individually. If some people complete their projects early and are willing, I will teach you some more advanced concepts. 

Here are the basic concepts we will be covering in the start of the term:
☐ Download and install Python
☐ Functions
☐ Statements
☐ Variables
☐ User-defined functions
☐ Control flow (if, else, loops etc.)
☐ Simple objects
☐ Complex objects
☐ Modules and standard library
☐ Classes

We also might learn the following concepts depending on time and your willingness:
☐ Lambda
☐ List comprehension
☐ Algorithms
☐ Terminal work
☐ Ask me if there’s anything else you want to learn and I’ll probably teach it to you
