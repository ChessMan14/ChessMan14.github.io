		<center><h1>Welcome to the Python Programming CAS club!</h1></center>
		<p>
Here’s how this club will work: I will help you install Python and teach you basic concepts, syntax and terms, then we will create one or two simple projects. Then for the rest (60-80% of the term), I will help and guide each of you in creating your own projects individually. If some people complete their projects early and are willing, I will teach you some more advanced concepts. 

<br>Here are the basic concepts we will be covering in the start of the term:
<br>☐ Download and install Python
<br>☐ Functions
<br>☐ Statements
<br>☐ Variables
<br>☐ User-defined functions
<br>☐ Control flow (if, else, loops etc.)
<br>☐ Simple objects
<br>☐ Complex objects
<br>☐ Modules and standard library
<br>☐ Classes

<br><br>We also might learn the following concepts depending on time and your willingness:
<br>☐ Lambda
<br>☐ List comprehension
<br>☐ Algorithms
<br>☐ Terminal work
<br>☐ Ask me if there’s anything else you want to learn and I’ll probably teach it to you
